Binary Trees
Description
In computer science, various data structures help in arranging data in different forms. Among them, trees are widely used abstract data structures that simulate a hierarchical tree structure. A tree usually has a root value and subtrees that are formed by the child nodes from its parent nodes. Trees are non-linear data structures.

A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.

A parent node has two child nodes: the left child and right child. Hashing, routing data for network traffic, data compression, preparing binary heaps, and binary search trees are some of the applications that use a binary tree.

This knowledge is applied to the solving of each task therein in this repository.
